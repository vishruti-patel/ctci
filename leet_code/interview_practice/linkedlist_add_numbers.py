"""
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
"""

"""
Notes:
we need to add digit by digit. There could be possibility of carry. for eg, 7 +7 = 14. So in digit variable we need to keep 4
and 1 will be placed in carry variable. Now how do we do that in python. 
for that we use modulo (%) and we use integration divider/floor dividor (//)
% -> remainder
//  -> quotient.

so if in [3,7] and [6,7], I will start by adding 7, 7 as the list is in reverse order. 
so let's say ADD = l1 + l2  which is (7 + 7)
now, carry = ADD // 10 which is (14 // 10)= 1
and, digit = ADD % 10 which is (14 % 10 = 4). So this digit will be then linked as the new node in the list.
