# 📝 Meta 2 PONTERSS Prep Cheat Sheet

---

## 🔹 1. **Opposite Ends (Two Sum Style)**

👉 Used when array is **sorted** or when you’re minimizing/maximizing something between two ends.

**Core trick:**

* If sum too small → move left pointer.
* If sum too big → move right pointer.

* ✅ [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
* ✅ [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
* ✅ [15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
* ✅ [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)
* ✅ [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

## 🔹 2. **Sliding Window (Substring / Subarray problems)**

👉 Both pointers move in the same direction. Window expands with `right`, shrinks with `left`.

**Core trick:**

* Add to window as `right` grows.
* If condition breaks → shrink with `left`.
* Track max/min while moving.

* ✅ [209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)
* ✅ [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/)

## 🔹 3. **Fast & Slow Pointers (Linked List style)**

👉 Two pointers move at different speeds.

**Core trick:**

* `slow = slow.next`, `fast = fast.next.next`.
* Detect cycles, find midpoints, etc.

* ✅ [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
* ✅ [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
* ✅ [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)
* ✅ [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

---

## 🔹 4. **Partitioning / In-place Reordering**

👉 Used when rearranging array elements without extra space.

**Core trick:**

* Keep left pointer at "valid" side, right pointer scanning forward.
* Swap or skip based on condition.

* ✅ [75. Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)
* ✅ [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
* ✅ [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)
* ✅ [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

---


## 🔹 5. **Greedy Threshold Tracking (special subsequence problems)**
👉 Related to two-pointers but uses variables as “pointers” to thresholds.

**Core trick:**
* Track smallest, then second smallest.
* If you find a number bigger than both → answer is true.

* ✅ [334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/)
* ✅ [456. 132 Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/132-pattern/) (harder version with stack)
