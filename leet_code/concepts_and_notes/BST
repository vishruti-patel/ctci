- Binary Tree

Binary Tree is a type of DS which is non-linerar and hierarchial
- Has at most 2 children - Left Node and Right Node.
- Each node in Binary Tree has 2 parts: Data, Pointer to left chil, Pointer to Right Child

# Types of Binary Trees:
1. Based on Nodes Values:
    - BST
    - AVL
    - B Tree
    - B+ Tree
    - Red Black Tree
    - Segment Tree

2. Based on no. of children:
    - Full BT
    - Degenerate BT
    - Skewed BT

3. Based on completion of levels:
    - Complete BT
    - Perfect BT
    - Balanced BT

# Operations on Binary Tree:
1. Tree Traversal.
    We can traverse tree by 2 ways - 
        - DFS(Depth First Search): Pre-order traversal (Node ,Left, Right)
                                    In-Order  (Left, Node, Right)
                                    Post-Order (Left, Right, Node)
        - BFS 
2. Insert new node in Tree
3. Delete a node
